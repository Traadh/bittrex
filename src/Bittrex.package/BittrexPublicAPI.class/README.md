I am an abstract class for Bittrex API commands 
which are public so don't need to be signed.  

Mainly I provide an organisational placeholder for human perception.
I add only a single method #signRequest that does nothing.

These APIs are easiest to experiment with first.
They can be called without any setup at Bittrex web site.
